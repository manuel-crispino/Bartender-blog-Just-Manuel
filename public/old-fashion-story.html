                    If you are a whiskey lover then you probably love old fashion cocktail too.
                    <br>
                    The Pendennis Club, a gentlemen's club founded in 1881 in Louisville, Kentucky.
                    <br>
                    Now in Louisville the Old Fashion is celebrated the first 2 weeks of June .
                    <br>
                    Here is where the Old Fashion gained poplarity where a barman had made it in
                    honor of Colonel James E. Pepper, a famous bourbon distiller.
                    <br>
                    The Old Fashion was born even earlier, the very first mention in print of "old
                    fashioned cocktail" was in the Chicago Daily in February 1880s.
                    <br>
                    But already since May 13th 1806 in New York tabloid 'The Balance and Columbian
                    Repository' defined a cocktail as "a stimulating liquor, composed of spirits of
                    any kind, sugar, water and bitters...".
                    <br>
                    13th of May is now used to celebrate the international Cocktail Day.
                    <br>
                    Considering Angoustura bitter was made in 1824, by Dr. Johann Siegert .
                    <br>
                    It is very difficult to find out the real origin of this cocktail but for sure
                    ,it was one of the first ever created .
