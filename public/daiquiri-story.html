                        The Daiquiri nice drink right? , if you are guessing who made this drink we are manys asking the same question ,
                        But we know daiquiri is a beach, somewhere in Santiago Cuba.
                        <br>
                        There are 2 storys.
                        <br>
                        So the first story is about one american marine going to daiquiri after his  long travel,
                        finally arrived.
                        <br>
                        He was so thursty and decied to looking for any kind of bar ,
                        he found the closest in Daiquiri beach.
                        <br>
                        Clean water was not really easy to find that time,instead what they had was rum ,
                        but the marine refuse to drink neat rum.
                         <br>
                        Wait ,just imagine the scenario in that time . 
                        <br>
                        An american marine try to speak spanish 
                         and a cuban barista try to understand english.
                         <br>
                         preatty funny right?.
                         <br>
                         i imagine this conversation like; 
                         <br>
                         Marine "Hi Hola senior i am thursty agua porfavor" ;
                         <br>
                         Cuban bar-man: " lo siento amigo no hay agua solo agua ardiente no water solo water ardiente ";
                         <br>
                         Marine:"No entiendo what do you mean? ";
                         <br>
                         Cuban bar-man:"esto! this! solo this, quiere provar?"
                         <br>
                         In this moment the marine try it and sayd: "ooooh this is rum my godness so strong can you mix it with something? mixare porfavor"
                         <br>
                        Cuban bar-man :"si claro hombre solo hay lime y azucar ,lime e sugar";
                        <br>
                         And yes, there you go a new cocktail just invented named after the beach, Daiquiri!.
                         <br>
                         funny right? that was my preferite . 
                         <br>
                         Second story more credible less funny there was an American mining engineer.
                         <br>
                          Named Jennings Cox,
                         it was in cuba and he just went to the bar, close to the beach Daiquiri.
                         <br>
                        He asked the bartender 
                         to mix some rum with something i guess more or less the same scenario as before
                         same conversation, in Cuba they only had  Rum lime and sugar so there you go, Daiquiri. 
                         <a class="link-text" href="daiquiri.html">Here the recipe</a>
