                    in El Floridita.

                    </a>
                    made this cocktail famous.
                    <br>
                    The real story of the Mojito is unknown but there are many legends about Mojito
                    <br>

                    From the Native indians that used to used as a medicine ,to El drake that used
                    to do the same cocktail but with brandy . But to be honest i have strong doubts
                    about both this stories because if you think about mojito without ice would be
                    very very undrinkable so by logic and considering ice start being imported from
                    the late 1850's .
                    <br>
                    I consider this story much more truthful and is about slaves working in sugar
                    cane fields that used to drink El
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarcane_juice">Guarapo.</a>
                    This give the base of the Mojito cocktail probably someone add some lime due the
                    scurvy also the origin of the word Mojito, Mojadito in Spanish Means a little
                    wet. 
                    <br>
                     Which if you also translate in spanish Aguardiente that means burning water
                    , in spanish language or Slang is possible to say is a little wet probably
                    referring to little bit of aguardiente.
                    <br>
                    If we also consider the era where this drink was born where water was not very pure and clean make sense to use a bit of Aguardiente with lime mint and sugar to safely drink and beat the hot weather .
