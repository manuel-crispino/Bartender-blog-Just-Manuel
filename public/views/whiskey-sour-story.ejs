                        Whiskey sour one of the best drinks and one of my preferite asweel ,very easy and refreshing.
                        <br>
                        the story of this drink is unknow the really first time someone has mentioned about,
                         was in the Jerry Thomas guide in 1862 
                         <a href="https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1876-Bar-Tender-s-Guide-by-Jerry-Thomas/10/">
                            The Bar-tenders guide by Jerry Thomas</a>.
                         <br>
                         But in the 1800s many sailors used to mix citruses with water and whiskey ,
                         to avoid scurvy and also keep the water clean.
                         <br>
                         Ok now imagine to be a sailor in the 1800s boat going somewhere around the big ocean you dont
                         even know if you will be back alive.
                         <br>
                         but at least you know in any case,
                          that you will have enough whiskey sour untill your last day of life .
                         <br>
                         You dont have to fear the big waves and see tornados anymore you can be drunk all day long sir.
                         <br>
                        Well maybe not the best life in our era but i guess back there was a great end or a great life expirence if you would have survive .
