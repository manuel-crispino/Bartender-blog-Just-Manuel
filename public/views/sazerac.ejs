                        Well i have to say i love Cognac and if you love cognac like i do than you will
                        love a well made sazerac .
                        <br>
                        I personally like to use gum or syrup as sugar due to its dissolvability in the
                        drink Aaron Bird created this cocktail 1850s was not so easy to
                        find ice in that time , reason why in many bars is still serve without, but i
                        personally like to drink it with a nice ice ball .
                        <br>
                        Is a very well balance drink i think is also very complete has all the flavours
                        that i look for, in a cocktail.

                        From the warm notes of cognac to the complexity herbals and bitter of the Peychaud ending with the balsamic note of the 
                          absinthe  mix to the sweetness of the sugar.
                        <br>
