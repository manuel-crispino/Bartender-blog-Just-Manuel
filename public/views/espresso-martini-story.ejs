                        The origin of this drink, is not so long ago, The 1980s London.
                        <br>
                        Fred's Club, a young beautiful lady came to the bar she was probably a model,
                        very beautiful.
                        <br>
                        It was friday night, the club vibe was pretty on fire and a long night was ahead
                        the barman was Dick Bradsell.
                        <br>
                        He was pretty in a rush as always when the bar is getting busy.
                        <br>
                        Being behind the bar can be hell.
                        <br>
                        But something unexpected was happening that night Bradsell was focused on making
                        drinks when a smell of nice perfume came trough his nose .
                        <br>
                        He looked up and there she was, a beautiful lady smiling at him , for a moment
                        the hell became paradise .
                        <br>
                        He stopped for a second until she said "hey how you doing?."</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>
                        Bradsell:</h3>
                    <p>"hey,very good thank you !,How about you ?."</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Young Lady:</h3>
                    <p>"i am good,thanks but very tired it was a long day and a long night is still
                        ahead i think i need a special drink tonight can you do that ?."</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>
                        Bradsell:</h3>
                    <p>"yes of course i can you talking to one of the best in the business!. tell me
                        more, give me some input what do you like ?"</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Young Lady:</h3>
                    <p>"I think i need something strong but not too much, maybe with coffee something can wake me up and F***ks me up! ."
                        <br>
                        Bradsell Laughed for a second and  thought for few more seconds untill he said
                        :"ok i have it! lets try this."
                        <br>
                        In Italy it was and is, very famous the "caffe shakerato" .
                        <br>
                        That means shaken coffe so he probably knew that, and he also thought about
                        another drink the
                        <a href="black-russian,html">Black Russian</a>.
                        <br>
                        So he knew they could work together and decided to try so he made the espresso fast added
                        5cl vodka and 3cl kaluha shook all .
                        <br>
                        And there you go nice foamy coffee cocktail was ready.
                        <br>
                        when the lady tried it was so excited that she start shouting :"Wooow this is the
                        best drink i have ever tried "".
