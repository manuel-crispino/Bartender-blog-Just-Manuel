                    Am√©d√©e Peychaud the bitter inventor he was originally from the French colony
                    Sant-Domingue now Haiti.
                    <br>
                    Emigrated to New Orleans during Haiti revolution he opened a small Apothecary
                    where he used to sell his own bitter.
                    <br>
                    At the beginning was a remedy against indigestion until, around 1850s Sewell T.
                    Taylor sold his New Orleans bar, the Merchants Exchange Coffee House.
                    <br>
                    And become an importer of spirits, and he began to import a brand of cognac
                    named Sazerac-de-Forge.
                    <br>
                    The new owner , Aaron Bird assumed proprietorship of the Merchants Exchange and
                    changed its name to Sazerac Coffee House.
                    <br>
                    Where he used to sell The Sazerac cocktail made with Sazerac cognac,sugar
                    absinthe and the local bitter of the local apothecary.
                    <br>
                    A lot of people consider sazerac as the very first cocktail ever invented but is
                    wrong as i said from
                    <a class="link-text" href="old-fashion-story.html">Old fashion story</a>
                    Also now is very use to make this cocktail with Rye Whiskey , because in 1870s
                    due phylloxera insect that have invaded grape in europe was much easier and
                    cheaper to use American Rye whiskey.
                    <br>
                    But as i said in the recipe i love cognac and i really enjoy the original
                    sazerac recipe , if i am behind the bar i always ask the guest .
                    <br>
                    But my personal recipe for my self i use cognac .
